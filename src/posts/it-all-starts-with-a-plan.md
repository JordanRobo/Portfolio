# It All Starts With a Plan

If you have been following along with my posts so far then you'll know that I have recently decided to shift careers into software development and that I've also decided I'm going to single handedly create my own Headless CMS that feels like Wordpress but performs far better thanks to Rust.

So... Where do I start?

Well before I start typing out a bunch of code in VS Code I should probably come up with some goals and a plan.
