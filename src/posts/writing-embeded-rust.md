Ok, so to be honest, this article is mainly for my own reference because there are so many steps to getting your development environment setup and I keep forgetting them and can't be bothered switching between countless browser tabs to figure out how to do it again. So this mainly targeted at future me, that doesn't mean you can't read along but just know that I'm my own target audience for this article (things could get weird).

1. Do you remember the different levels of abstraction? Which one do you need? (PAC, HAL, BSP)
2. What MCU do you have? 
   1. What processor does your micro-controller use?
   2. What architecture does that processor use?
   3. Check you have the correct target installed with `rustup`
   4.
